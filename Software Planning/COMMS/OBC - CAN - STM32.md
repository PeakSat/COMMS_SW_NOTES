#### Description of Action
During safe mode OBC requests heartbeat from COMMS. What would happen if COMMS does not send back the message. Maybe a power cycle from EPS...Maybe a change in the software image of COMMS. Here is a tricky situation because if the CAN BUS malfunctions for some reason we could lock out from the spacecraft. So a solution on that is 1) perform all the FDIR but never close the RF.
#### Moment of Action
During safe mode of the spacecraft
#### Why
Part of the Safe mode procedure.
