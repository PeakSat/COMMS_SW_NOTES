#### Description of Action
Stored GNSS data have to be transmitted to the Ground Station.
#### Moment of Action
With a telecommand.
#### Why
Necessary for the TLE generation.
#### Questions and Concerns 
Here's a communication only between COMMS and GS. So there must be a TC only for COMMS. Another thought is that this TC would reach first OBC and then OBC will command COMMS to send the GNSS data to GS.
